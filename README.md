Work check in /out

What it is: This is a very simple work check in/out program. 

Purpose: I have to work on several projects a day and I regularly forget to write down how much time I spent on each project. This prog will hopefully solve my problem. (it might be useful for others)

How it works: after startup, a small form, which is always present on the desktop, logs the current time in a text file when the button on it is pressed (the program only uses the resources of the computer when the button is pressed)
The log file is also saved on the desktop under the name "time".
The log file will document the start time (in) and end time (out) of the session and the elapsed time (Sum). the time between out-int is not summed.

The program is a bit primitive and ugly if you want to improve it,  I'm for it.
